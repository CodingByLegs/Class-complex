# Realization of work with complex numbers

* Code style check: cpplint


## Discription

This is my first task with programming language C++ - realitation of Class Pointer, that have:
###This program can calculate complex numbers, also there is overload of this operators:
*"+"
*"-"
*"/"
*"*"
*"=="
*"<<"
"<<" work with "cout"

###Anouther functions:
*Add(const Complex& c) - add two complex numbers
*output() - display complex number

###Some constructors:
*Complex() - defoult, real and imaginary parts are equal zero
*Complex(const Complex &c) - copy "c" to new object
*Complex(double _re, double _im) - first parameter - real part, second - imaginary
*Complex(double _re) - real part - first parameter, imaginary part is equals zero
